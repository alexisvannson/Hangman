# Hangman Game

Overview
Welcome to the Hangman game! This simple Python-based Hangman game allows you to guess a word letter by letter. Try to guess the word before the hangman is fully drawn!

How to Play
Run the Python script.
You will be shown the initial display with underscores representing each letter in the word.
Guess a letter by entering it in the input box.
If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed; otherwise, the hangman drawing will progress.
Keep guessing until you either guess the word correctly or the hangman is fully drawn.
Game Features
Gallows Drawing: The hangman is displayed as you make incorrect guesses on the interface generated by turtle.
Guessed Letters: The guessed letters and their positions in the word are displayed.
Winning and Losing: The game ends with a win message if you guess the word correctly and a lose message if you make too many incorrect guesses.
